// Here are some key technologies typically employed in the process:

1. React
2. JavaScript (ES6+)
3. Node.js
4. React Router

// To run a React app locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Set up the development environment**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org). The installation process differs depending on your operating system.

2. **Create a new React app**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your React app. Then, run the following command to create a new React app using Create React App:

   ```shell
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```

   Replace `my-app` with the desired name of your application.

3. **Navigate to the app's directory**: After the installation process is complete, navigate to the newly created app directory by running the following command:

   ```shell
   cd my-app
   ```

   Replace `my-app` with the actual name of your application.

4. **Start the development server**: Once inside the app's directory, run the following command to start the development server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.

5. **View the app in the browser**: After running the previous command, your React app should be running locally. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.
